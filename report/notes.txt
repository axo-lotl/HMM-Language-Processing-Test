What counts as an "observation?"

There are over 3000 distinct words. Then O has dimensions [# states, ~3500]
which is quite undesirable. Despite this, there doesn't seem to be a better
approach.
Some sample length-10 sequences:
5 states: a of in flame yellow and care heart am love
10 states: better i to is hold pricked for to each up
20 states: i taught yet a have applying all part manys perfectst
40 states: my dedicated might golden and my no it a tickled
80 states: my i bear his being from every upon with reckon


Supervised Based on Stress Signature:
In an attempt to accomplish metering, we tried a supervised HMM with the states
being the stress signature of the word. The stress signature simply denotes
whether each syllable in the word is stressed or unstressed. For example,
"savannah" is 010, since only the second syllable is stressed. "Whistling" is
10. There were 19 unique stress signatures in Shakespeare's poems, the most
common being 0 (2872 times) and 1 (11158 times). The least common were 0010 and
1101, each occuring one time. Therefore, we made 19 states.

Next we try supervised based on part of speech.
